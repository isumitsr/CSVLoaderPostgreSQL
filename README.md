# CSVLoaderPostgreSQL
This application (exe) can take csv file path and table_name as an input from user and then load the csv file directly to postgreSQL database called - projectBloom. Modify the "conn" dict in the py code by adding your postgreSQL connection info and then run the command to create exe using pyinstaller pkg, and just RUN exe. See the magic!
